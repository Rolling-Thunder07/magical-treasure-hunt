Welcome to the most unnecessarily elaborate way to procrastinate on your actual responsibilities! This is a text-based adventure game written in C (yes, C - because I'm apparently stuck in 1972 and proud of it) where you explore a mystical castle, annoy wizards with your presence, and hunt for treasure like a caffeinated Indiana Jones with commitment issues.

**🎓 Academic Achievement Unlocked**: This masterpiece was crafted as a DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) project assignment, proving that learning can be fun when you add enough wizards and terrible puns. Created in collaboration with a dear friend <a href="DhananjayLogDMax" target="_blank">Dhananjay 👦</a> who probably questions our life choices as much as I do! 🤝💻

<br>

## 🎮 What Even Is This?

Remember when games had actual imagination instead of just better graphics? Yeah, me neither, but I decided to create one anyway! This is a console-based adventure where you:

- 🚶‍♀️ Stumble around a 10-room castle like a lost tourist
- 🧙‍♂️ Meet 5 wizards who apparently have nothing better to do than quiz random strangers
- 🧩 Answer riddles that range from "Harry Potter trivia" to "things your grandpa would ask"
- 💎 Find treasure (spoiler: it's in room 7 - oops, did I say that out loud?)
- 💀 Die spectacularly if you get too many answers wrong (bazinga! - death by trivia)
<br>

## 🎯 Features That Will Blow Your Mind*
*Results may vary. Mind-blowing not guaranteed.

- **🌈 COLORS!** Because black and white terminals are for quitters
- **🗺️ Dynamic Map System** - Watch your sad little path grow as you get more lost
- **❤️ Lives System** - You get 2 lives because I'm generous (unlike real life)
- **⏱️ Time Tracking** - So you can see exactly how much of your life you've wasted
- **🧠 Memory Management** - I use malloc() like a responsible adult (mom would be proud)
- **📊 Step Counter** - Because apparently we're turning exploration into a fitness tracker now
<br>

## 🏰 The Cast of Characters (AKA My Imaginary Friends)

### The Wizards Who Definitely Need Hobbies:

![wizards](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36ea4af7-9fab-4fad-ab56-fab3cd49851d)


- **🧙‍♂️ Albus Dumbledore** - Asks about levitation charms (yes, it's *Wingardium Leviosa*, Hermione)
- **🖤 Severus Snape** - Tests your Horcrux knowledge (emo wizard energy)
- **🐱 Minerva McGonagall** - Poses riddles that would make your brain hurt
- **🐻 Rubeus Hagrid** - Talks about magical creatures (probably wants to adopt them all)
- **💀 Lord Voldemort** - The final boss who's basically a magical psychopath
<br>

### The Locations (My Virtual Real Estate Portfolio):
- 🚪 **Castle Entrance** - Where dreams begin and hope dies
- 📚 **Ancient Library** - For when you want to feel intellectually superior
- ⚰️ **Ancient Crypt** - Spooky vibes only
- 🌿 **Eastern Garden** - Nature, but make it mystical
- 🗼 **Tower Base** - Vertical architecture appreciation zone
- 🔗 **Dungeon** - 50 Shades of Medieval
- 🧪 **Alchemist's Laboratory** - Breaking Bad: Fantasy Edition
- 💎 **Treasure Room** - The whole point of this exercise
- 🏛️ **Great Hall** - Where epic stuff probably happened once
- 🔮 **Secret Chamber** - Because every castle needs one
<br>

## 🛠️ Installation (AKA How to Ruin Your Productivity)
![typing](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/784145d3-2f9c-4a23-b865-1860eb3028ea)

### Prerequisites:
- A C compiler (gcc recommended, unless you're feeling adventurous)
- A terminal that supports ANSI colors (most do, unless you're using Windows XP)
- The ability to type without looking at the keyboard (optional but impressive)
- A sense of humor (mandatory)

### Compilation Ritual:
```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/Rolling-Thunder07/magical-treasure-hunt.git
cd magical-treasure-hunt

# Compile like it's 1999
gcc src/treasure_hunt.c -o treasure_hunt

# Run and question your life choices
./treasure_hunt
```

### For Windows Users (My Condolences):
```cmd
# Use WSL or suffer in silence
# Or try: gcc treasure_hunt.c -o treasure_hunt.exe
```
<br>

## 🎲 How to Play (Like You Need Instructions)

1. **Run the game** - `./treasure_hunt`
2. **Read the pretty intro** - I spent time on those ASCII decorations
3. **Choose your destiny** - Use numbers 1-6 like a civilized human
4. **Navigate the castle** - North/South/East/West (it's not rocket science)
5. **Meet wizards** - Answer their riddles or face the consequences
6. **Find the treasure** - It's literally the objective
7. **Brag to your friends** - As if they'll be impressed
<br>

### Controls (Because Apparently This Needs Explaining):
- **1** - Go North ⬆️ (up, away from your problems)
- **2** - Go South ⬇️ (down, toward your destiny)
- **3** - Go East ➡️ (right, because left is wrong)
- **4** - Go West ⬅️ (left, but we don't talk about that)
- **5** - Show Map 🗺️ (for when you're hopelessly lost)
- **6** - Quit 🚪 (coward's way out)

## 🤓 Technical Mumbo Jumbo (For Fellow Code Nerds)

- **Language**: C (because I hate myself and love pointers)
- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Structs, Linked Lists (the holy trinity)
- **Memory Management**: Dynamic allocation with malloc() (living dangerously)
- **UI**: ANSI color codes (fancy terminal aesthetics)
- **Input Validation**: Robust error handling (unlike my life choices)
- **Architecture**: Procedural programming (old school cool)

### Code Statistics (That Nobody Asked For):
- **Lines of Code**: ~500+ (We got carried away)
- **Functions**: 15+ (decomposition is key, kids)
- **Structs**: 3 (Location, Wizard, Question - the perfect trio)
- **Global Variables**: A few (I know, I know, but sometimes you gotta live a little)
- **Comments**: Excessive (future me will thank present me)
<br>

## 🐛 Known Issues (AKA My Shame List)

- Wizards might judge your life choices (working as intended)
- Some riddles are harder than others (life isn't fair)
- You might get addicted to this pointless game (seek help)
- The treasure room might be too easy to find (I'm not great at hiding things)
- My Hindi-English mixed comments might confuse you (cultural diversity!)

*Instagram? Facebook? Twitter? I don't have time for those - I'm too busy debugging my social life. Plus, my relationship status with social media is "It's Complicated" (mostly because I spend more time talking to compilers than humans).* 😅

## 🎯 Final Words

This game represents approximately 47 hours of my life that I'll never get back, 23 cups of coffee, 8 existential crises, and 1 moment of pure satisfaction when it finally compiled without warnings.

If you enjoy this game, great! If you don't, that's okay too - I already have imposter syndrome anyway.

Now go forth and find that treasure! And remember: in a world full of AAA games with billion-dollar budgets, sometimes the best adventures happen in a humble terminal window with nothing but imagination and way too much free time.

*May your pointers never be null, and may your segfaults be few.*

**Happy Adventuring! 🎮✨**
